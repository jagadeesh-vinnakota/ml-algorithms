# Machine Learning

### Is a part of artificial intelligence which is used to observe data and predict the future. Some real time implementations are
     
     1. clasiifying email as spam or not
     2. Predecting stock price
     3. Grouping news documents by analyzing their content


## Any machine learning problem falls into these two categories.
    
   ### Supervised Learning: Model uses training data to learn a link between the input and the outputs
       1. Classification: For tasks like classying email as spam or not.
       2. Regression: For tasks like predicting the tomorrow's wether.
    
   ### Unsupervised Learning: Does not use output data
        1. Clustering: Used for grouping the data like clustering the documents based on the content
        2. Anamoly Detection: Detect outliers that behave differently from most of the data.
