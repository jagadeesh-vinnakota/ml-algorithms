# Pre-requisites to run this on your machine
    
    1. Install Anaconda (this will install python as well on your system): https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

### Use jupyter notbook to open the code and start playing with it

    1. Be in the home directory of this github repository.
    2. conda update conda
    3. conda upgrade conda
    4. jupyter notebook .
    
    This will open the file system in jupyter notebooks and you this to become familiar on how to use jupyter.

# Machine Learning

### It is a part of artificial intelligence which is used to observe data patterns and predict the future. Some real time implementations of machine learning that we use in our daily life are
     
     1. clasiifying email as spam or not
     2. Predecting weather
     3. On online news forums, grouping of news documents according to their content
     

## Any machine learning problem falls into these two categories.
    
   ### Supervised Learning
       Model uses training data to learn a link between the input and the outputs
       1. Classification: For tasks like classying email as spam or not.
       2. Regression: For tasks like predicting the tomorrow's weather.
    
   ### Unsupervised Learning
       Does not use output data
        1. Clustering: Used for grouping the data like clustering the documents based on the content
        2. Anamoly Detection: Detect outliers that behave differently from most of the data.
