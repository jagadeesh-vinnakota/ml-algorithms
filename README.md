# Machine Learning

### It is a part of artificial intelligence which is used to observe data patterns and predict the future. Some real time implementations of machine learning that we use in our daily life are
     
     1. clasiifying an incoming email as spam or not
     2. Weather forecast
     3. Grouping of news documents on online news platform according to their content
     

## Any machine learning problem falls into these two categories.
    
   ### Supervised Learning

       Model uses training data to learn a link between the input and the outputs
       1. Classification: For tasks like classying email as spam or not.
       2. Regression: For tasks like predicting the tomorrow's weather.
    
   ### Unsupervised Learning

       Does not use output data
        1. Clustering: Used for grouping the data like clustering the documents based on the content
